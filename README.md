Black boxes are essential components in transportation systems, such as airplanes and automobiles, as they are used to analyze root causes of accidents. To ensure their effectiveness, continuous tracking and recording of critical events, like over-speeding, break failure, gear box failure, and other essential factors are significant. This project focuses on designing the core features of a ‘car black box’ using a PIC microcontroller(PIC18F4580), leveraging its advanced hardware capabilities. Significant events will be recorded in EEPROM, which is durable and reliable data storage.
